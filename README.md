## Small thank you and quick feedback from me :)

Firstly, I want to thank you for a chance in this recrutation :D I really love React and working with this technology is my dream so this recrutation really makes me happy even if I don't complete this asigment sucesfully.
Secendly, I want to get my feedback on my work and talk about how I done it :)

- I used Redux as my state controll managment tool
- I needed unfortunetly moment.js for operations on time becouse of the api which shipped time only with shift in seconds from UTC. Moment.js helped me a lot here with calculations.
- I didn't do tests becose of the lack of time it was really productive weekend and I didn't had a chance to use DDD here. I would use jest here and test redux logic precisely.

## How to open my project

1. Production mode:
- go to weather-app folder using console
- start app using "npm start" commend in console

2. Deployed project:
  - to see deployed project go to https://remarkable-kulfi-d088cb.netlify.app/

#Thank you and see you soon :)
